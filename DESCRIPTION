Description: Package for implementing Bayesian Rule Set (BRS) in R,
    as well as graphical tools introduced in Chiu and Xu (working 
    paper). BRS is an interpretable machine learning algorithm that
    uses rule sets to classify data. This package also allows users
    to create bar plots, t-SNE plots, and chord diagrams to help
    visualize the results of BRS.
