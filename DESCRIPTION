Description: R package for implementing Bayesian Rule Set (BRS), a method introduced by Wang et al. (2017), as well as graphical tools introduced in Chiu and Xu (2023). BRS is an interpretable machine learning algorithm that
    uses rule sets to classify data. This package also allows users
    to create bar plots, t-SNE plots, and chord diagrams to help
    visualize the results of BRS.
